# CAD-Treasures-Isaiah-45-1-8
1This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed,  whose right hand I have grasped  to subdue nations before him,  to disarm kings,  to open the doors before him,  so that the gates will not be shut:  2â€œI will go before you  and level the mountains;a  I will break down the gates of bronze  and cut through the bars of iron.  3I will give you the treasures of darkness  and the hidden riches of secret places,  so that you may know that I am the LORD,  the God of Israel, who calls you by name.  4For the sake of Jacob My servant  and Israel My chosen one,  I call you by name;  I have given you a title of honor,  though you have not known Me.  5I am the LORD, and there is no other;  there is no God but Me.  I will equip you for battle,  though you have not known Me,  6so that all may know,  from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting,  that there is none but Me.  I am the LORD, and there is no other.  7I form light and create darkness;  I bring prosperity and create calamity.  I, the LORD, do all these things.  8Drip down, O heavens, from above,  and let the skies pour down righteousness.  Let the earth open up  that salvation may sprout  and righteousness spring up with it;  I, the LORD, have created it.
